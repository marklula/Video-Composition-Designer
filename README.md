# Video-Composition-Designer
This tool provides a visual way to generate a video matrix command for a user defined input group for Cisco Devices that can then be used for Macros.

You use this tool by first selecting the codec (EQ or Pro) and then a desired layout. You can then drag and drop the inputs (numbered to match the physical inputs with #4 being USB-C on an EQ) to generate the preview of your layout. The xCommand string to leverage this layout for use in a macro, command line or local web interface is displayed in real time as you make changes to the inputs used.
