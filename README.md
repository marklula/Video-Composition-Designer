# Video-Composition-Designer
Video compositing allows for multiple video inputs on Cisco Codecs to be mixed into a single video out that is sent to your meetings or calls. This tool provides a visual way to generate a video matrix command for a user defined input group for Cisco Devices that can then be used for Macros.

Video compositing does NOT affect the local layout of screens or incoming video.

To use this tool, You can select between Codec EQ or Codec Pro and then a desired layout. Then, simply drag and drop the inputs from the left side menu to the canvas. As you change layouts, the inputs will arrange based on the composition.

The xCommand string to leverage this layout for use in a macro, command line or local web interface is displayed in real time as you make changes to the inputs or layouts used.
